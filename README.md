# Introduction:
This is a collection of scripts for LENA related works. Please see the specific readme for the script that you want to run.

## Requirements:
Most of scripts are written in Python. If you are going to run a script with GUI, you may also need to install GTK binding with python. In order to ease the work for none-programmer users, I prepared a [standalone environment](https://github.com/babylanguagelab/public-scripts/blob/master/library/python_with_gtk.zip?raw=true) which contains all the required libraries for these scripts. You just need to install this package once, and they can run all the scripts without any problems. 
* [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
* [gtk-3](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/PyGObject?action=show&redirect=PyGObject)

## GUI Applications:
